You should use your own api key, and should replace your api key with mine. To get the api key follow the following steps:
Create an account in https://www.themoviedb.org/. Click on the `API` link from the left hand sidebar in your account settings and fill all the details to apply for API key.If you are asked for the website URL, just give "NA" if you don't have one.You will see the API key in your `API` sidebar once your request is approved.



The datasets are collected from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset). However they are already present in the repository. If you don't find any file in repository, then you should download the movie_metadata.csv, movies_metadata.csv and credits.csv from the above links.
